I was born and brought up in AGRA (U.P). i love to interact with creative minds like yours .
Currently I'm a first year BTech student . I usually solve problems in creative ways.I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies in modern day needs from my surroundings .
I used to participate in various debates, group discussions(GD) recitations and other volunteering program too during my school days. I usually remember those golden days of school when you have time to play, fight with friends and had something that might be missing today.
